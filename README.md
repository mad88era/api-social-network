# api-social-network

My task is to develop an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ posts, and manage a friend list. I will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and Mongoose as the ODM. Besides the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I may optionally use a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

Since no seed data is provided, I will create my own data using Insomnia after building the API. As this application will not be deployed, I need to create a walkthrough video demonstrating its functionality and ensuring all acceptance criteria are met. I will submit a link to this video and include it in the README of my project.

## API Documentation
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up, running, and testing the Social Network API. The API facilitates the management of a social network system where users can share thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and add friends.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Download & Install Node.js and the npm package manager.
